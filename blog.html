      <h2>To express one's opinion</h2>
      <!-- my own writing piece  -->
      <h3><em>Monday, October 9, 2017</em></h3>
      <p> To express one's opinion requires one of the two conditions: <br>
        (1) ultimate belief that one is right<br>
        (2) trust that one's opinion would be respected whether it holds right or wrong
        <br>
        <br>
        For long, I thought I just did not have an opinion. For about all issues, I remained neutral, ready to be swayed by both sides, right in the middle. I realized recently that I was just not brave enough. I was not trusting my opinions to be right. I was not trusting other people to be respectful.
        I was afraid that I would say something that is out of place and I was scared that people would bring my opinions down, bring me down. I did not want to be "wrong".
        <br>
        <br>
        But what can be wrong in an "opinion"? Unless you are suggesting to kill someone, to discriminate against a group of people based on their skin tones, sexualities, political orientations, religions, ethnicity, or to harm the innocent, no opinion should be condemned "wrong."
        After all, it is an opinion - it is a suggestion, it is a feeling, it is a thought; it is not a statement, it is not a law, it is not the standard. It is called an opinion for a reason.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nowadays, people say "I think", "I believe", "In my opinion", before saying anything because they are scared of being put down, being rejected, being turned down as "wrong."
        Why? Why should we be so damn scared of expressing our opinions?
        <br>
        It is because we want to get affirmed by other people, we want other people to agree with our opinions, feel like we belong in a group, be approved that we are not outcasts.
        Saying something that is not the norm, that is different from what the majority's saying is shut down and often not respected.
        <br>
        <br>
        This kills freedom. This kills creativity. This kills individuality. This kills the opportunity for people to become a better individual and for the society to advance.
        Without diverse opinions, without much argument, without conflicts of opinions, we are not learning. If we are just getting confirmation from each other, we cannot grow.

        <br>
        <br>
        At least for me, I want someone to say "No, I think differently. My opinion is …" I want someone to disprove me, of course with valid reason, and start a conversation - tell me why they think differently. I want constructive criticisms.
        I want conflicting viewpoints for me to think about, to reflect.
        <br>
        <br>
        If open space where everyone's opinions is respected is the optimal learning atmosphere, how can we as a society create and provide such place for all?

        Voicing one's opinion is hard. It is taking a risk to be wrong, to be put down. In an ideal society, anyone should be able to voice one's stance whether it is politically, socially different from the standard and still be respected.

      <h2>Imagination</h2>
      <!-- my own writing piece  -->
      <h3><em>Sunday, November 20, 2016</em></h3>
      <p>Whether I'm sitting on the train, changing into my gym uniform, or waiting in line to buy my lunch, I never waste a spare moment diving into my world of fiction. Growing up as an only child, I often imagined myself as Alice exploring Wonderland, a soldier who was ordered to kill a child during the wars, a flapper of the 1920s, the protagonist Elinor of Sense and Sensibility, or the mother of a victim of the 9/11 attacks. As I personified these characters and heroes, I asked myself: Would I have made the same decisions? Would I have jumped into a rabbit hole leading into the unknown? Would I have the courage to stand up for humanity and social justice? Would I be able to forgive the terrorists who murdered my child? Some of these questions could be easily answered but others could not.
        <br>
        <br>
        Embodying different characters inside my world of imagination allows me to feel and think in perspectives outside of my own. I have the freedom to travel back in time or foresee the future. It does not matter whether I am the hero or villain of a story; I can experience the lament of defeat, the excitement from a win, or even the grief from an unethical decision. In this fictional world, I am the princess who cannot choose her own prince, the knight who solemnly sacrifices himself to save the kingdom, and the mad scientist who plans to take over the world. Through each character's story, I am better able to understand the different values, beliefs, and priorities that influence his or her decision. Here, I have learned to respect the opinion of others. Here, I have learned to understand that people are sometimes forced to make choices because of their circumstances. Here, I have learned that my decision can save or hurt others. These lessons are real and I live them out in my life everyday.
        <br>
        <br>
        My love for imagination is not to escape reality but to examine it. Imagination forces me to define, evaluate, and articulate essential values: faith, justice, valor, camaraderie, and love. I believe using our imagination is a natural human instinct. Skeptics may criticize that this drives humans to live in dystopian fantasies instead of facing reality. However, I am aware that in the real world, not all people are kind and righteous, the innocent are taken advantage of and evil often wins. At the same time, I still believe in the goodness of humanity. It may be in my naiveté, but living in this imagination as storybook characters allows me to have faith in the nobility of humankind, that good will be chosen over evil. Goodness, honesty, and love are important motifs demonstrated in folktales and childhood stories from ages past; morals that heroes sacrifice their lives to protect. My imagination allows me to continue experiencing and hoping in things that may be lost or hard to find in this world.

      <h2>Perfect and Imperfect. Imperfect and Perfect.</h2>
      <!-- my own writing piece  -->
      <h3><em>Monday, July 4, 2016</em></h3>
      <p>All people are imperfect.
        <br> No one can be so loving, so open, so ready to put their needs on the bottom and willingly help others without expecting anything in return.
        <br> I have met no one like that, not a person.
        <br> Actually, all people are perfect.
        <br> People are born to learn, born to love, born to grow.
        <br> It is the potential that makes people perfect.

    <h2>TED Talk by BJ Miller "What Really Matters at the End of Life"</h2>
    <h3><em>Saturday, July 25, 2016</em></h3>

      <!-- Inspired by TED talk "What Really Matters at the End of Life"-->

      <p>I remember I watched this months ago on the bus from the Heathrow, England airport to Oxford Seminar program.
        <br> At that time, this was not very interesting to me, and I did not give much thought to it.
        <br>Death seemed very distant from me that I could not relate to it just yet.
        <br>Even though I have not still experience any death since then, listening to it the second time allowed me to think about it.
        <br>I was always afraid of the idea of death - being alone, dying, and having no one remembering me.
        <br>I wanted to live so I can be remembered. Now, I am not sure. Maybe I don't have to be remembered so well.
        <br>It has become more about finding me and accepting myself. I am searching for my purpose.
        <br>What would really matter at the end of my life is whether I have realized who I am and what I am here for, allowed myself to be fully me and fulfilled my purpose.
        <br>Miller, it seems to me, has found his purpose and is working towards his own goal.
        <br>Life and Death, and all suffering and pain in between them. They are all worthy because they are part of living a life.

    <h2>TED Talk by Brene Brown “The Power of Vulnerability”</h2>
    <h3 ><em>Saturday, July 25, 2016</em></h3>

      </div>
      <p>It was last summer when I first realized how insecure I was as a person.
        <br>Without realizing it myself, I have been pretending to appear as someone I was not really; this scared me a little, and I wanted to encounter the problem.
        <br>However, I was scared when I started to acknowledge the insecure part of me.
        <br>I could no longer see what part of me is really me and what part of me is a mask.
        <br>By talking to my friends and families, I’ve slowly come to understand that I was insecure because I tried to hide that I am vulnerable.
        <br>I wanted to be the perfect person, the wonderful girl that had everything right about her.
        <br>I worked hard so no one would see my weaknesses. I forced myself to become someone who I wasn’t and no one could be.
        <br>I should get mad. I should cry. I should not force myself to smile all the time.
        <br>I should laugh when I want to and only when I truly feel like laughing.
        <br>I should not have tried to control my feelings. Feelings are not to be controlled.
        <br>I had to embrace parts of me that may be ugly, instead of keeping them hidden.
        <br>It is still difficult for me to accept myself as who I am, but now at least I know what I have to fight for – I have to fight to find myself, accept myself, and be able to say “I am beautiful” looking in the mirror.
        <br>It will be a tough fight, and it will become even more difficult surrounded by new people who may or may not accept me as who I am, but I will fight this time. I will not hide from who I am.
        <br>Even though my description above is very vague, I am still afraid that someone will find out about me.
        <br>I am already conflicted whether I should post this on Internet or not.
        <br>Shouldn’t I just keep it to myself? Shouldn’t I just wait until I become fully accept myself and be confident before I post such thing?
        <br>I am so insecure and want to retreat back, back to home, where I am safe, where no one can read my thoughts.
        <br>But, I remembered this quote from someone “If not me, then who? If not now, then when?”.
